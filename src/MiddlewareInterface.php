 * Middleware.
 *
 * Middleware accepts a request and a response, and optionally a
 * callback `$out` (called if the middleware wants to allow further
 * middleware to process the incoming request, or to delegate output to another
 * process).
 *
 * Middleware that does not need or desire further processing should not
 * call `$out`, and should usually instead `return $response->end();`.
 *
 * For the purposes of Conduit, `$out` is typically one of either an instance
 * of `Next` or an instance of `FinalHandler`, and, as such, should follow
 * those calling semantics.
