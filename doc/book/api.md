# API Reference

The following make up the primary API of Stratigility.

## Middleware

`Zend\Stratigility\MiddlewarePipe` is the primary application interface, and
has been discussed previously. Its API is:

```php
namespace Zend\Stratigility;

use Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface;
use Interop\Http\Middleware\ServerMiddlewareInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

class MiddlewarePipe implements MiddlewareInterface, ServerMiddlewareInterface
{
    public function pipe(
        string|callable|ServerMiddlewareInterface|ServerRequestInterface $path,
        callable|ServerMiddlewareInterface|ServerRequestInterface $middleware = null
    );

    public function __invoke(
        ServerRequestInterface,
        ResponseInterface $response,
        callable $out = null
    ) :  ResponseInterface;

    public function process(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        DelegateInterface $delegate
    ) : ResponseInterface;
}
```

`pipe()` takes up to two arguments. If only one argument is provided,
`$middleware` will be assigned that value, and `$path` will be re-assigned to
the value `/`; this is an indication that the `$middleware` should be invoked
for any path. If `$path` is provided, the `$middleware` will only be executed
for that path and any subpaths.

Middleware is executed in the order in which it is piped to the
`MiddlewarePipe` instance.

The `MiddlewarePipe` is itself middleware, and can be executed in stacks that
expect the `__invoke()` signature (via the `__invoke()` signature), or stacks
expecting http-interop middleware signatures (via the `process()` method).

When executing the `MiddlewarePipe` via its `__invoke()` method, if `$out` is
not provided, an instance of `Zend\Stratigility\FinalHandler` will be created
and used in the event that the pipe stack is exhausted (`MiddlewarePipe` passes
the `$response` instance it receives to `FinalHandler` as well, so that the
latter can determine if the response it receives is new).

> ### $out is no longer optional
>
> Starting in version 1.3.0, we now raise a deprecation notice if no argument is
> passed for the `$out` argument to `__invoke()`; starting in version 2.0.0,
> the argument will be required.  Always pass a `Next` instance, a
> `Zend\Stratigility\NoopFinalHandler` instance, or a custom callback; we no
> longer recommend the `FinalHandler` implementation.

When using `__invoke()`, the callable `$out` argument should use the signature:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

function (
    ServerRequestInterface $request,
    ResponseInterface $response
) : ResponseInterface
```

Within Stratigility, `Zend\Stratigility\Next` provides such an implementation.

Starting in version 1.3.0, `MiddlewarePipe` also implements the http-interop
`ServerMiddlewareInterface`, and thus provides a `process()` method. This
method requires a `ServerRequestInterface` instance and an
`Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface` instance on invocation; the latter
can be a `Next` instance, as it also implements that interface.

Internally, for both `__invoke()` and `process()`, `MiddlewarePipe` creates an
instance of `Zend\Stratigility\Next`, feeding it its queue, executes it, and
returns its response.

### Response prototype

Starting in version 1.3.0, you can compose a "response prototype" in the
`MiddlewarePipe`. When present, any callable middleware piped to the instance
will be wrapped in a decorator (see the [section on middleware
decorators](#middleware-decorators), below) such that it will now conform to
http-interop middleware interfaces.

To use this functionality, inject the prototype before piping middleware:

```php
$pipeline = new MiddlewarePipe();
$pipeline->setResponsePrototype(new Response());
```

## Next

`Zend\Stratigility\Next` is primarily an implementation detail of middleware,
and exists to allow delegating to middleware registered later in the stack. It
is implemented both as a functor and as an `Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface`.

### Functor invocation

Because `Psr\Http\Message`'s interfaces are immutable, if you make changes to
your Request and/or Response instances, you will have new instances, and will
need to make these known to the next middleware in the chain. `Next` expects
these arguments for every invocation. Additionally, if an error condition has
occurred, you may pass an optional third argument, `$err`, representing the
error condition.

```php
class Next
{
    public function __invoke(
        Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request,
        Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response
    ) : Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
}
```

You should **always** either capture or return the return value of `$next()` when calling it in your
application. The expected return value is a response instance, but if it is not, you may want to
return the response provided to you.

> ### $err argument
>
> Technically, `Next::__invoke()` accepts a third, optional argument, `$err`.
> However, as of version 1.3.0, this argument is deprecated, and usage will
> raise a deprecation notice during runtime. We will be removing the argument
> entirely starting with version 2.0.0.

> ### $response argument
>
> Using the `$response` argument is unsafe when using delegation, as an inner
> layer could return an entirely different response, ignoring any changes you
> may have introduced previously. Additionally, when manipulating the response
> from an inner layer, you may be inheriting unwanted context.
>
> As such, we recommend ignoring the `$response` argument and doing one of the
> following:
>
> - For innermost middleware that will be returning a response without
>   delegation, we recommend instantiating and returning a concrete
>   response instance. [Diactoros provides a number of convenient custom responses](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-diactoros/custom-responses/).
> - For middleware delegating to another layer, operate on the *returned*
>   response instead:
>
>   ```php
>   $response = $next($request, $response);
>   return $response->withHeader('X-Foo', 'Bar');
>   ```

### Delegate invocation

- Since 1.3.0.

When invoked as a `DelegateInterface`, the `process()` method will be invoked, and
passed a `ServerRequestInterface` instance *only*. If you need to return a response,
you will need to:

- Compose a response prototype in the middleware to use to build a response, or a
  canned response to return, OR
- Create and return a concrete response type, OR
- Operate on a response returned by invoking the delegate.

### Providing an altered request:

```php
// Standard invokable:
function ($request, $response, $next) use ($bodyParser)
{
    $bodyParams = $bodyParser($request);
    return $next(
        $request->withBodyParams($bodyParams), // Next will pass the new
        $response                              // request instance
    );
}

// http-interop invokable:
function ($request, DelegateInterface $delegate) use ($bodyParser)
{
    $bodyParams = $bodyParser($request);

    // Provide a new request instance to the delegate:
    return $delegate->process(
        $request->withBodyParams($bodyParams)
    );
}
```

### Returning a response to complete the request

If your middleware does not need to delegate to another layer, it's time to
return a response.

While we pass a response when using `Next` as a functor, we recommend creating
a new response, or providing your middleware with a response prototype; this
will ensure that the response is specific for your context.

```php
use Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response;

$prototype = new Response();

// Standard invokable signature:
function ($request, $response, $next) use ($prototype)
{
    $response = $prototype->withAddedHeader('Cache-Control', [
        'public',
        'max-age=18600',
        's-maxage=18600',
    ]);
    return $response;
}

// http-interop invokable signature:
function ($request, DelegateInterface $delegate) use ($prototype)
{
    $response = $prototype->withAddedHeader('Cache-Control', [
        'public',
        'max-age=18600',
        's-maxage=18600',
    ]);
    return $response;
}
```

### Delegation

If your middleware is not capable of returning a response, or a particular path
in the middleware cannot return a response, return the result of executing the
delegate.

If using the legacy middleware signature, invoke the `$next` argument:

```php
return $next($request, $response);
```

If using a `DelegateInterface`, invoke its `process()` method:

```php
return $delegate->process($request);
```

**Middleware should always return a response, and, if it cannot, return the
result of delegation.**


### Raising an error condition

- Deprecated as of 1.3.0; please use exceptions and a error handling middleware
  such as the [ErrorHandler](error-handlers.md#handling-php-errors-and-exceptions)
  to handle error conditions in your application instead.

To raise an error condition, pass a non-null value as the third argument to `$next()`:

```php
function ($request, $response, $next)
{
    try {
        // try some operation...
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        return $next($request, $response, $e); // Next registered error middleware will be invoked
    }
}
```

## FinalHandler

- Deprecated starting with 1.3.0. Use `Zend\Stratigility\NoopFinalHandler` or a
  custom handler guaranteed to return a response instead.

`Zend\Stratigility\FinalHandler` is a default implementation of middleware to execute when the stack
exhausts itself. It expects three arguments when invoked: a request instance, a response instance,
and an error condition (or `null` for no error). It returns a response.

`FinalHandler` allows two optional arguments during instantiation

- `$options`, an array of options with which to configure itself. These options currently include:
  - `env`, the application environment. If set to "production", no stack traces will be provided.
  - `onerror`, a callable to execute if an error is passed when `FinalHandler` is invoked. The
    callable is invoked with the error (which will be `null` in the absence of an error), the request,
    and the response, in that order.
- `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response`; if passed, it will compare the response passed
  during invocation against this instance; if they are different, it will return the response from
  the invocation, as this indicates that one or more middleware provided a new response instance.

Internally, `FinalHandler` does the following on invocation:

- If `$error` is non-`null`, it creates an error response from the response provided at invocation,
  ensuring a 400 or 500 series response is returned.
- If the response at invocation matches the response provided at instantiation, it returns it
  without further changes. This is an indication that some middleware at some point in the execution
  chain called `$next()` with a new response instance.
- If the response at invocation does not match the response provided at instantiation, or if no
  response was provided at instantiation, it creates a 404 response, as the assumption is that no
  middleware was capable of handling the request.

## HTTP Messages

### Zend\Stratigility\Http\Request

- Deprecated in 1.3.0; to be removed in 2.0.0.

`Zend\Stratigility\Http\Request` acts as a decorator for a `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface`
instance. The primary reason is to allow composing middleware such that you always have access to
the original request instance.

As an example, consider the following:

```php
$app1 = new Middleware();
$app1->pipe('/foo', $fooCallback);

$app2 = new Middleware();
$app2->pipe('/root', $app1);

$server = Server::createServer($app2 /* ... */);
```

In the above, if the URI of the original incoming request is `/root/foo`, what `$fooCallback` will
receive is a URI with a past consisting of only `/foo`. This practice ensures that middleware can be
nested safely and resolve regardless of the nesting level.

If you want access to the full URI — for instance, to construct a fully qualified URI to your
current middleware — `Zend\Stratigility\Http\Request` contains a method, `getOriginalRequest()`,
which will always return the original request provided to the application:

```php
function ($request, $response, $next)
{
    $location = $request->getOriginalRequest()->getUri()->getPath() . '/[:id]';
    $response = $response->setHeader('Location', $location);
    $response = $response->setStatus(302);
    return $response;
}
```

### Zend\Stratigility\Http\Response

- Deprecated in 1.3.0; to be removed in 2.0.0.

`Zend\Stratigility\Http\Response` acts as a decorator for a `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`
instance, and also implements `Zend\Stratigility\Http\ResponseInterface`, which provides the
following convenience methods:

- `write()`, which proxies to the `write()` method of the composed response stream.
- `end()`, which marks the response as complete; it can take an optional argument, which, when
  provided, will be passed to the `write()` method. Once `end()` has been called, the response is
  immutable and will throw an exception if a state mutating method like `withHeader` is called.
- `isComplete()` indicates whether or not `end()` has been called.

Additionally, it provides access to the original response created by the server via the method
`getOriginalResponse()`.

## Middleware

Stratigility provides several concrete middleware implementations.

#### ErrorHandler and NotFoundHandler

These two middleware allow you to provide handle PHP errors and exceptions, and
404 conditions, respectively. You may read more about them in the
[error handling chapter](error-handlers.md).

### OriginalMessages

This callable middleware can be used as the outermost layer of middleware in
order to set the original request, URI, and response instances as request
attributes for inner layers. See the [migration chapter](migration/to-v2.md#original-request-response-and-uri)
for more details.

## Middleware Decorators

Starting in version 1.3.0, we offer the ability to work with http-interop
middleware. Internally, if a response prototype is composed in the
`MiddlewarePipe`, callable middleware piped to the `MiddlewarePipe` will be
wrapped in one of these decorators.

Two versions exist:

- `Zend\Stratigility\Middleware\CallableMiddlewareWrapper` will wrap a callable
  using the legacy interface; as such, it also requires a response instance:

  ```php
  $middleware = new CallableMiddlewareWrapper($middleware, $response);
  ```

- `Zend\Stratigility\Middleware\CallableMiddlewareWrapper` will wrap a callable
  that defines exactly two arguments, with the second type-hinting on
  `Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface`:

  ```php
  $middleware = new CallableMiddlewareWrapper(
    function ($request, DelegateInterface $delegate) {
        // ... 
    }
  );
  ```

You can manually decorate callable middleware using these decorators, or simply
let `MiddlewarePipe` do the work for you. To let `MiddlewarePipe` handle this,
however, you _must_ compose a response prototype prior to piping middleware
using the legacy middleware signature.

## Delegates

In addition to `Zend\Stratigility\Next`, Stratigility provides another
`Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface` implementation,
`Zend\Stratigility\Delegate\CallableDelegateDecorator`.

This class can be used to wrap a callable `$next` instance for use in passing
to a `ServerMiddlewareInterface::process()` method as a delegate; the primary
use case is adapting functor middleware to work as http-interop middleware.

As an example:

```php
use Interop\Http\Middleware\DelegateInterface;
use Interop\Http\Middleware\ServerMiddlewareInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Zend\Stratigility\Delegate\CallableDelegateDecorator;

class TimestampMiddleware implements ServerMiddlewareInterface
{
    public function __invoke(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        ResponseInterface $response,
        callable $next
    ) {
        return $this->process($request, new CallableDelegateDecorator($next, $response));
    }

    public function process(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        DelegateInterface $delegate
    ) {
        $response = $delegate->process($request);
        return $response->withHeader('X-Processed-Timestamp', time());
    }
}
```
