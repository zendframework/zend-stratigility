As such, \nreturn\n$next(/* ... */)\n is the recommended workflow.\n\n\nRaising an error condition\n\n\nTo raise an error condition, pass a non-null value as the third argument to \n$next()\n:\n\n\nfunction ($request, $response, $next)\n{\n    try {\n        // try some operation...\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        return $next($request, $response, $e); // Next registered error middleware will be invoked\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFinalHandler\n\n\nZend\\Stratigility\\FinalHandler\n is a default implementation of middleware to execute when the stack\nexhausts itself. It expects three arguments when invoked: a request instance, a response instance,\nand an error condition (or \nnull\n for no error). It returns a response.\n\n\nFinalHandler\n allows two optional arguments during instantiation\n\n\n\n\n$options\n, an array of options with which to configure itself. These options currently include:\n\n\nenv\n, the application environment. If set to \"production\", no stack traces will be provided.\n\n\nonerror\n, a callable to execute if an error is passed when \nFinalHandler\n is invoked. The\n    callable is invoked with the error (which will be \nnull\n in the absence of an error), the request,\n    and the response, in that order.\n\n\nPsr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface $response\n; if passed, it will compare the response passed\n  during invocation against this instance; if they are different, it will return the response from\n  the invocation, as this indicates that one or more middleware provided a new response instance.\n\n\n\n\nInternally, \nFinalHandler\n does the following on invocation:\n\n\n\n\nIf \n$error\n is non-\nnull\n, it creates an error response from the response provided at invocation,\n  ensuring a 400 or 500 series response is returned.\n\n\nIf the response at invocation matches the response provided at instantiation, it returns it\n  without further changes. This is an indication that some middleware at some point in the execution\n  chain called \n$next()\n with a new response instance.\n\n\nIf the response at invocation does not match the response provided at instantiation, or if no\n  response was provided at instantiation, it creates a 404 response, as the assumption is that no\n  middleware was capable of handling the request.\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Messages\n\n\nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\Request\n\n\nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\Request\n acts as a decorator for a \nPsr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface\n\ninstance. The primary reason is to allow composing middleware such that you always have access to\nthe original request instance.\n\n\nAs an example, consider the following:\n\n\n$app1 = new Middleware();\n$app1-\npipe('/foo', $fooCallback);\n\n$app2 = new Middleware();\n$app2-\npipe('/root', $app1);\n\n$server = Server::createServer($app2 /* ... */);\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, if the URI of the original incoming request is \n/root/foo\n, what \n$fooCallback\n will\nreceive is a URI with a past consisting of only \n/foo\n. This practice ensures that middleware can be\nnested safely and resolve regardless of the nesting level.\n\n\nIf you want access to the full URI \u2014 for instance, to construct a fully qualified URI to your\ncurrent middleware \u2014 \nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\Request\n contains a method, \ngetOriginalRequest()\n,\nwhich will always return the original request provided to the application:\n\n\nfunction ($request, $response, $next)\n{\n    $location = $request-\ngetOriginalRequest()-\ngetUri()-\ngetPath() . '/[:id]';\n    $response = $response-\nsetHeader('Location', $location);\n    $response = $response-\nsetStatus(302);\n    return $response;\n}\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\Response\n\n\nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\Response\n acts as a decorator for a \nPsr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface\n\ninstance, and also implements \nZend\\Stratigility\\Http\\ResponseInterface\n, which provides the\nfollowing convenience methods:\n\n\n\n\nwrite()\n, which proxies to the \nwrite()\n method of the composed response stream.\n\n\nend()\n, which marks the response as complete; it can take an optional argument, which, when\n  provided, will be passed to the \nwrite()\n method. Once \nend()\n has been called, the response is\n  immutable and will throw an exception if a state mutating method like \nwithHeader\n is called.\n\n\nisComplete()\n indicates whether or not \nend()\n has been called.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it provides access to the original response created by the server via the method\n\ngetOriginalResponse()\n.",
